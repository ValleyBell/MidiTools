# MIDI Tools
various tools related to patching/modifying MIDI files

## Midi Splitter
This tool allows you to split MIDI tracks up based on certain criteria.

Currently you can:

- split by note: puts overlapping notes (e.g. chords) on separate tracks, so that each track is monophonic
- split by instrument: puts each instrument on a separate track, useful when editing e.g. xm2mid conversions
- split by channel: same as converting Format 0 to Format 1
- split by volume: make a separate track for each note velocity

I originally wrote this in 2012, but with an older version of my MIDI library.  


## MIDI Volume Converter
With this tool you can convert MIDI volume values to different scales.
This is what I wrote the tool for initially.

But you can also modify the volume of the MIDI,
which is what I use this tool for most of the time these days.

Converting volume scales is useful for e.g. fixing the velocities in MIDIs converted from PSX seq files.  
Supported scales are:

- `MIDI` - General MIDI scale (127 = 0 db, 90 = -6 db, 64 = -12 db, 45 = -18 db)
- `Lin` - linear scale (127 = 0 db, 64 = -6 db, 32 = -12 db, 16 = -18 db)
- `FM` - Yamaha FM scale (-0.75 db steps: 127 = 0 db, 119 = -6 db, 111 = -12 db)
- `PSG2` - SN76489 PSG scale (-3 db per 8 steps: 127..120 = 0 db, 119..112 = -2 db, 111..104 = -4 db)
- `PSG3` - AY8910 PSG scale (-2 db per 8 steps: 127..120 = 0 db, 119..112 = -3 db, 111..104 = -6 db)
- `WinFM` - scale used by Windows OPL3 FM MIDI driver

You can convert freely between the various scales.
The only exception is that you can not convert *to* WinFM.


# Libraries

## MidiLib.cpp/hpp
This is a MIDI library that allows you to read in MID files, modify them and write them back.
It is relatively low-level, but that's what I prefer.

One notable feature is, that it keeps track of the "running staus" of the original data.
This means you can write the files back with minimal changes to the byte stream.


# Complilation notes

Project files for VC++ 6 and VC2010 are included.

If you want to compile them with GCC, you need to link with *MidiLib.cpp* and the Math library `m`.

```
g++ -I. MidiLib.cpp <tool.cpp> -lm -o <tool>
```
